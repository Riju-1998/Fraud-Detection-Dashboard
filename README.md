# Fraud-Detection-Dashboard
Project Description: Fraud Detection Dashboard
Overview
The Fraud Detection Dashboard is an advanced analytical tool created using Power BI to monitor and analyse transaction data for potential fraudulent activities. This comprehensive dashboard integrates various data visualizations and metrics to provide insights into transaction patterns, fraud rates, and anomalies over time. It is designed to assist financial institutions and fraud analysts in identifying and mitigating fraudulent activities effectively.

Data Metrics
Total Transactions:
•	Description: Represents the total count of all transactions within the dataset.
•	Purpose: Provides a baseline for overall transaction activity.
Fraudulent Transactions:
•	Description: Count of transactions that have been identified and marked as fraudulent (isFraud).
•	Purpose: Highlights the volume of detected fraudulent activities.
Fraud Rate:
•	Description: Percentage of total transactions that are fraudulent.
•	Formula: (Fraudulent Transactions / Total Transactions) * 100
•	Purpose: Measures the proportion of fraudulent transactions, indicating the overall risk level.
Flagged Transactions:
•	Description: Count of transactions flagged as potential fraud (isFlaggedFraud).
•	Purpose: Identifies transactions that require further investigation.

Transaction Type Analysis
Transaction Type Breakdown:

Visualization:
 Bar chart
•	Description: Illustrates the count of each transaction type (e.g., PAYMENT, TRANSFER, DEBIT, CASH_OUT).
•	Purpose: Provides insight into the distribution of different transaction types within the dataset.
Fraud by Transaction Type:

Visualization:
 Bar chart
•	Description: Displays the count of fraudulent transactions categorized by transaction type.
•	Purpose: Identifies which transaction types are most susceptible to fraud.
Amount by Type:

Visualization: 
Donut chart
•	Description: Represents the distribution of transaction amounts by type.
•	Purpose: Visualizes how transaction amounts are allocated across different types.

Fraud by Type:
Visualization:
 Donut chart
•	Description: Shows the distribution of fraudulent transactions by type.
•	Purpose: Highlights which types of transactions are more prone to fraud.
Conclusion
The Fraud Detection Dashboard leverages Power BI's powerful visualization capabilities to provide a detailed and interactive analysis of transaction data. By incorporating key metrics, time series analysis, transaction type breakdowns, geographic distribution, and outlier detection, this dashboard serves as a crucial tool for detecting and preventing fraudulent activities. It enables stakeholders to make informed decisions and implement effective fraud mitigation strategies
